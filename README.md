# PandaX4T-scattering-event-location-reconstruction
The project aims to develop a solution for scattering event location reconstruction in PandaX4T TPC, at higher resolution and better performance distinguishing single/multiple scattering events' charge pattern, basically with Richardson-Lucy & Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model.

## src
Contains source code for PSF calculation and location reconstruction

## Test_inputs
Contains typical event example files

## Intermediate_variables
Contains PSF calculated with 164keV events

## Result_examples
Contains expected results derived from source codes
