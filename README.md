# PandaX4T-scattering-event-location-reconstruction

The project aims to develop a solution for scattering event location reconstruction in PandaX4T TPC, at higher resolution and better performance distinguishing single/multiple scattering events' charge pattern, basically with Richardson-Lucy & Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model.
